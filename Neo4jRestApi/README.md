Neo4j and the REST API from Java
================================

I have tried to develop a code using the latest Jersey library that upto date is 2.18 (see at <a href="https://jersey.java.net/index.html" target="_blank">Jersey 2.18</a>)
The goal is to use the REST API from Java when auth is required to access Neo4j. For more information see my blog on
